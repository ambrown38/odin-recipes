    <p>For this recipe, you will need a cocktail shaker, a jigger, a hawthorne strainer, ice, Bourbon, Amaro Nonino, Aperol, and freshly squeezed lemon juice.  I like to serve mine in a frosted Nick and Nora glass.</p>

    <p>Using a a hawthorne stainer and and additional small fine mesh stainer, double strain the cocktail into the frosted glass just removed from the freezer.</p>
