    <h2>To Make:</h2>

    <p>Traditionally, Amatriciana is made with guanciale and bucatini.  The guanciale is from Amatrice, the birthpalce of the pasta.  Most of the time I'm not a purest, because Guanciale from Amatrice can be difficult to source here in America.  So I'll substitute with pancetta or bacon.  You will also need a can of whole tomatoes and Pecorino Romano cheese.</p>
    <p>Dump the pasta into a pot of salted, boiling water that tastes like the sea.</p>
    <p>Dice the Guanciale, bacon, or pancetta into small cubes.  Dump into a cold pan, turn the heat on to medium-low, medium, gradually bringing the heat into the pan.  Render out the fat.</p>
    <p>Once rendered, remove the meat from the pan and the oil.  At this point, you may deglase with a little bit of white wine.  Pour the tomatos into the pan, crushing each tomato with your bare hands.  Cook over medium to medium high heat.</p>
    <p>When the pasta is al dente, remove from water with a pair of kitchen tweezers, and place into the pan with the sauce.  Add pasta water as needed in order to cream the sauce.</p>
    <p>Once the sauce is creamed, turn off the heat</p>
    <p>At this point add in the grated Pecorino Romano, and most of the Guanciale.  Sprinkle remaining Guanciale on top as a garnish.  Sprinkle cheese as necessary.</p>
