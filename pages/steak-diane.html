    <h2>To Make:</h2>

    <div>
      <p>Assuming you've dry brined your meat and it's tempered, on a cutting board, place on sheet of plastic wrap, your steak, and then a second sheet of plastic wrap on top, so you've made a plastic wrap steak sandwich.  With the flat side of meat mallet, beat you meat until it is one inch thick.  Do not season with salt again</p>
      <p>Bring you pan to temperature in the method discussed in the <a href="../pages/steak-au-poivre.html">Steak au Poivre</a>recipe.</p>
      <p>Cook your steaks to desired doneness, no warmer than medium you savages.  Place the steaks somewhere out of the pan to rest.</p>
      <p>In the same pan you used to cook the steaks, after removing excess fat, add a touch more oil and then the diced shallot.  After 30 seconds add a pint of thinly sliced button mushrooms, white or cremini.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, prep the 1/3 cup of brandy.  When mushrooms are cooked sufficiently, remove the pan from the flame and add the brandy - not from the bottle from a seperate mixing container, flambe, and deglaze, scraping the fond from the bottom of the pan.  When the brandy is almost gone, add beef stock.</p>
      <p>After the beef stock has appropriately reduce, add a spoonful of dijon mustard, mix, and then add heavy cream until the color is as you like it.</p>
      <p>Place steaks in the sauce, baste them with the sauce, and then plate the steaks, spooning sauce over the meat.</p>
      <p>Enjoy.</p>
