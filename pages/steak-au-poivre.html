    <h2>To Make:</h2>

  <div>
    <p>Pat dry your meat, place on a wire rack resting in a sheet pan, salt all sides, and place in the fridge overnight.  This is called dry-brining.  The next day, remove steaks and pat dry again.  Crush whole pepper corns and spread out in a flat layer over a cutting board, pressing the presentation side of the filet's into the pepper so that they stick, forming a layer.  Make sure you temper your meat before you begin to cook.</p>
    <p>Heat a pan, stainless steel works well here, so that when you drop a spoonful of water on the surface, it balls up and dances around on the pan.  Put in your oil andn then carefully lay in your peppered steak, lest you get oil burns from the splatters because you were too violent and lacked finesse.</p>
    <p>Flip the steak after a few minutes.  After a few more minutes, remove the steaks from the pan a let rest.  Drain excess fat from the pan.</p>
    <p>Turn the heat to the pan that you cooked the steaks in back on, add a touch more oil, and add the diced shallot.  Meanwhile, have a 1/3 cup of brandy ready to go into the mix.</p>
    <p>When the moisture has cooked out of the shallots, remove the pan from the flame, add in the brandy - not from the bottle but from a measure cup - and flambe.  When the flame has subsided the alcohol has burned off, with a wooden spoon scrape all of the fond off the bottom of the pan.  Reduce brandy until almost gone.</p>
    <p>At this point add beef stock and reduce until it reaches a consistency where you can run a wooden spoon across the bottom of the pan and the liquid hold like the parting of seas.  It is at this point you add heavy cream - which I measure by color, which ever shade of light brown I am feeling on that particular evening.</p>
    <p>Reduce sauce for a few more minutes, check for seasoning, adjust if necessary.  Which at this point is just adding if needed.  Remember, you can't unseason.  Add in green peppercorns from brine and heat through for a few more seconds.</p>
    <p>Plate the steaks, drizzle over the sauce, and serve.</p>
