      <p>To prepare a Negroni, you will need a cocktail mixing glass, a jigger, a hawthorne or julip strainer, ice, and Campari, Gin, and Sweet or Italian Vermouth.  Finally, you will need a strip of orange peel freshly remove to both express the essential oils from the fruit and for garnish.</p>
      <p>First, measure equal parts of Campari, Gin, and Vermouth into the mixing glass.  Add ice so that the level of the liquid is in the center of your quantity of ice, then mix the cocktail with a cocktail spoon until there is condensation on the outside of the mixing glass.</p>
      <p>Using a hawthorne or julip strainer, pour the cocktail into a fresh glass over ice, take a orange strip and twist over the drink, expressing the oils.  Use the orange strip as a garnish.</p>
      <p>Enjoy your cocktail.  It is bitter, but makes a great apertivo.  Cheers!</p>
